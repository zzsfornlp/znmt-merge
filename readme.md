## NMT decoding with recombination

Hi, this is an implementation of the paper "Exploring Recombination for Efficient Decoding of Neural Machine Translation" in EMNLP 2018.

Please refer to the paper for more details: [paper](http://aclweb.org/anthology/D18-1511) [bib](http://aclweb.org/anthology/D18-1511.bib)

## Usage

### Train:
Fisrt, we need a NMT model, use `train.py` to get it. Please refer to `examples/train.sh` as an example for the training of En-De and Zh-En models.

### Test:
Next, use the trained models for NMT decoding with `test.py`, see `examples/test.sh` as the reference.

### Options:
Please refer to `examples/options.md` for descriptions about cmd options.

### Requirements:
This code is implemented in python3 with [the DyNet toolkit](https://github.com/clab/dynet/). Please use a relatively newer version of DyNet, we tested it with the version of [this commit](https://github.com/clab/dynet/commit/e3bce8e54044b64a9990f506eba8652b11222afa).
